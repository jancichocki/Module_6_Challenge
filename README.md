## Conclusion

The analysis underscores the diversity in the San Francisco housing market, with certain neighborhoods standing out as attractive investment options. The upward trend in rental income relative to sale prices in some areas suggests a viable buy-and-rent strategy, particularly in neighborhoods where rental growth outpaces sale price increases.

## Insights for Investment Strategy

Considering the growth in rental income and the varying trends in sale prices, neighborhoods exhibiting rapid rental growth with stable sale price increases are recommended for investment. These areas offer a balanced opportunity for rental income and capital appreciation.
